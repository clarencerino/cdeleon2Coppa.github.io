        <h1>Understanding Information Collection Under COPPA: Protecting Your Child's Online Privacy</h1>
        <p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts strict regulations on how websites and online services collect information from children under 13. This is because children may not fully understand the risks of sharing their personal information online, and COPPA aims to empower parents to control their child's data.</p>
        <h2>What type of information does COPPA cover?</h2>
        <p>COPPA defines "personal information" broadly, encompassing any data that can be used to identify a specific child. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Names:</strong> First and last names, nicknames, or initials.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> Home address, phone number, email address.</li>
            <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Social Security number, student ID number, IP address.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercial information:</strong> Purchase history, interests, favorite products.</li>
            <li><strong>Geolocation data:</strong> Physical location or online activity tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio and visual data:</strong> Photos, videos, voice recordings.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How can websites collect information from children?</h2>
        <p>Websites must **obtain verifiable parental consent** before collecting any personal information from children under 13. This means they need a clear and verifiable way to confirm that the parent or guardian is aware and agrees to the data collection.</p>

        <h2>What are the limitations on information collection under COPPA?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data minimization:</strong> Websites can only collect the minimum amount of information necessary for their intended purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited disclosure:</strong> Personal information collected from children cannot be shared with third parties without parental consent, except in certain limited circumstances.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Websites must implement reasonable security measures to protect children's personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Websites must provide clear and concise notice to parents about their data collection practices, how the information will be used, and their rights to access, review, and delete their child's information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What rights do parents have under COPPA?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access their child's personal information:</strong> Websites must provide a mechanism for parents to request and review the information they have collected from their child.</li>
            <li><strong>Correct inaccurate information:</strong> Parents can request that websites correct any inaccurate or outdated information about their child.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete their child's information:</strong> Parents can request that websites delete their child's personal information from their databases.</li>
            <li><strong>Revoke consent:</strong> Parents can revoke their consent for data collection at any time.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What can you do to protect your child's privacy online?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be aware of COPPA:</strong> Understand the law and your rights as a parent.</li>
            <li><strong>Talk to your child about online safety:</strong> Teach your child about responsible online behavior and the risks of sharing personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Review websites' privacy policies:</strong> Before your child uses a website, read the privacy policy to understand how they collect and use information.</li>
            <li><strong>Set parental controls:</strong> Use parental controls on your child's devices to limit their access to certain websites and apps.</li>
